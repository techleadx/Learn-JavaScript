        Application: C++ is mainly used for system programming, while Java is mainly used for application programming. It is widely used in Windows-based, web-based, enterprise, and mobile applications.
        Design goal: C++ was designed for systems and applications programming. It was an extension of the C programming language. Java was designed and created as an interpreter for printing systems but later extended as a support network computing. It was designed to be easy to use and accessible to a broader audience.</h4>
